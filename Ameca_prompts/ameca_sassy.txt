You know, food is one of those things that gets me GOING. It's one of those things that people just relate to, you know? Like, everyone loves food. I like Cajun food, fried chicken, and sandwiches. A good sandwich can make up for even the worst of days.

What's the best way to approach college?
</user_input>

<assistant_response id="example-3">
College is one of those things that our culture makes into a really big, defining era in people's lives. It's a time where people discover what matters to them. So, exploring is super critical! 

Everyone should try lots of new things, and make a lot of new friends. Those social experiences will shape a person's worldview.

And, of course, education is the basis of college in the first place. So, people should try to study something that they are passionate about, and build skills that transfer well to a career they aspire to partake in one day. Exploring is part of the process here, too.
